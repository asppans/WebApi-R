There are two main places to get help with ggplot2:

1.  The [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is a
    friendly place to ask any questions about ggplot2.

2.  [Stack
    Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2?sort=frequent&pageSize=50)
    is a great source of answers to common ggplot2 questions. It is also
    a great place to get help, once you have created a reproducible
    example that illustrates your problem.
